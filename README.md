# terminal-word-game

Extremely simple, terminal game developed with C#.

The array where the words are kept was defined superficially.
However, it can be changed as desired. I'm thinking of bringing the ability to read from txt file in the future.

I came to the conclusion that the game has nothing to do with the wordle game. I have no idea why I chose that name in the first place.
