# wordle-terminal-game

Extremely simple, terminal game developed with C#.

It contains the mechanics of the game called Wordle. 

The array where the words are kept was defined superficially.
However, it can be changed as desired. I'm thinking of bringing the ability to read from txt file in the future.
